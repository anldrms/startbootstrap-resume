                                Since July 2021, I have been working as an Associate System Engineer at Trendyol Group, based in Istanbul, Turkey. Trendyol operates within the larger Trendyol group structure, which includes Dolap, the largest second-hand platform in the country, Trendyol Express, a delivery network, and Trendyol Tech, an R&D center focused on digital transformation.

In my role at Trendyol, I am primarily responsible for configuring load balancing hardware and software and managing website traffic for the leading e-commerce platform in Turkey. My main objective is to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of our systems. This involves troubleshooting and resolving technical issues that may arise, as well as providing support to our users.

Additionally, I am responsible for the maintenance and upgrading of our systems, ensuring that they are up-to-date and perform optimally. I also contribute to the implementation of new features and functionality, actively participating in the continuous improvement and development of our systems.

Working at Trendyol has provided me with valuable experience in system engineering within the dynamic e-commerce industry. My role involves critical responsibilities that contribute to the seamless operation of the company's website, ultimately enhancing the overall customer experience.

                            <p>
                                During the period from April 2019 to July 2021, I was employed in Istanbul, Turkey. I worked at GittiGidiyor, which is Turkey's leading e-commerce marketplace. GittiGidiyor was founded in 2001 and became a dominant player in the industry over the course of 16 years. In 2011, the company became a part of eBay, the world's largest online marketplace.

                                At GittiGidiyor, I contributed to the company's success as it solidified its position in the Turkish e-commerce market. With an average of 60 million monthly visits and nearly 19 million registered users, GittiGidiyor is the preferred online shopping platform in Turkey. The platform offers millions of products in over 50 categories, catering to individual sellers, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and large enterprises.
                                
                                During my time at GittiGidiyor, I was involved in various aspects of the company's operations. I worked as a Network Operations Center (NOC) Engineer, responsible for monitoring and maintaining the large computer networks and servers from a centralized location. My role included analyzing problems, performing troubleshooting and incident response, communicating with on-site technicians, and ensuring timely resolution of issues.
                                
                                GittiGidiyor prides itself on providing a secure shopping experience for its users. The platform utilizes a "Zero Risk" payment and confirmation system, ensuring 100% safe online transactions. This approach has helped GittiGidiyor gain the trust of its customers and fostered the growth of individual sellers, SMEs, and large enterprises on the platform.
                                
                                However, it is important to note that GittiGidiyor operations closed on July 22. This information should be taken into account when considering my experience at the company.
